7. Once an opening is found, BearBot should play a sound, send a desktop notification, and click enroll for you. Enjoy!

> NOTE: It is very important that you keep the window open and do not close it. Navigating to other tabs within the chrome window you have open will stop the script. The best way to avoid this is to open a new chrome window and run the script. You can use chrome on other windows normally.
